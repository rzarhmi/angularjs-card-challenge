# AngularJS Card Challenage

An angular development challenge for showing cards in a responsive web application

## Introduction 
In this challenge, you are going to develop an angularjs responsive web application which shows a 
random card on the page and has a 'Try' button. Whenever the user clicks on the 'Try' button, 
you should show him another card in random order.

Each card has at least 2 items:

- title
- description

We have different Cards which are shown differently:

- **Picture Card** which shows a picture at the end of card content (code is 0)
- **Animated Card** which uses a special animation when it is shown (code is 1) (Use a good animation of your choice)
- **Sound Card** which plays a sound when the card is shown (code is 2)

Cards can be shown in different themes meaning they will use a different template, icon and color representing their tag:

- sport
- art
- fun

You can choose your desired template, icon and color for each theme.

You should initialize cards list from this URL: [http://static.pushe.co/challenge/json](http://static.pushe.co/challenge/json)

User is able to edit the title and description text on the cards and save it (just saved it locally, 
no need for sending the saved data to the server). After hitting 'Try' button several times, when visiting the 
same card again: the saved user text should be shown instead of original server text for title and description.

## Expectations

We expect a clean, readable and maintainable code with meaningful comments and js docs.
